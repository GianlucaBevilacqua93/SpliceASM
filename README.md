# SpliceASM

## Splice 1.0
This is a first attempt to implement through CoreASM language the protocol SPLICE/AS. Note that the abstraction level is very high at this stage. This provides a top down approach to its development.

## Splice 2.0
The second version includes, among the other things, a log file in order to track the agent's operations, which are sending or receiving a message (type cleartext or encrypted are not specified at this level).
